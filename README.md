This project presents the results of a survey conducted within Telegram channels dedicated to supporting Ukrainians in Germany.

Explore the interactive map showing the locations of these community chats and their relative sizes [here](https://arzik1987.github.io/survey_2024/survey_2024_template.html). The colour allows to differentiate between the channels and is currently used to reflect the level of our knowledge about each channel (to be clarified later). The circles are clickable and show the number of participants in each channel as of 11.11.2024, as well as a sample survey result (a placeholder for now). The menu in the top right corner allows you to switch between map designs and explore groups of chats separately.

More project details will be added as they become available.
