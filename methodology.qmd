title: "üìù Methodology"
---

This page explains the methodology behind our opinion poll, outlining the key phases of the project‚Äîfrom preparation to data processing and visualization.  
Unlike conventional polls, our methodology may have [**coverage bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll#Coverage_bias) and [**nonresponse bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_bias), which are difficult to quantify precisely. Although our results, where comparable, match those from official agencies quite well, extrapolating them to the overall population is at your own risk of erroneous conclusions.

### üìå 1. Preparation

At the preparation step we have analyzed the existing surveys of similar kind, decided on survey format, developed the bot which automatically collects the current results each time a new vote appears, and tested our ideas with a small scope sureveys.

**Research on existing surveys**.
We reviewed past surveys on Ukrainian refugees, particularly those related to Germany, to identify their intersection with our intended questionnaire. Our goal was to align demographic questions, such as age categories, with those used in other surveys to facilitate easier comparisons.

**Selecting the opinion poll format**.
Our primary focus was to explore the potential impact of our efforts. Given the small size of our core team, choosing Telegram channels dedicated to assisting Ukrainian refugees was a natural decision.  

To maximize participation, we kept the poll *simple* and *anonymous*. Simplicity ensured that participants could respond directly within the Telegram channels they were already part of, rather than through a separate bot-led channel or external forms (e.g., Google Forms). Anonymity allowed those who preferred to keep their privacy to participate freely.  

To achieve this, we used anonymous multi- and single-choice Telegram polls. Telegram allows maximum 10 choice options per poll. We ended up with the following three polls to maximally use this limit and to not owerwhelm responers with the number of polls.

1. Multiple choice poll: What problems related to moving and adapting to life in Germany are currently most important to you?

    <form>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Learning German</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Employment</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Bureaucratic procedures</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Professional education, retraining</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Housing, household setup</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Medicine</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Psychological problems</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Loneliness</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Adaptation and integration of children</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="main_issues"> Other options (including no critical problems related to moving to Germany)</label><br>
    </form>
    <p></p>

2. Single choice poll.

    <form>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a woman, aged 18 to 29</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a woman, aged 30 to 39</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a woman, aged 40 to 49</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a woman, aged 50 to 59</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a woman, older than 60</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a man, aged 18 to 29</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a man, aged 30 to 39</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a man, aged 40 to 49</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a man, aged 50 to 59</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="gender_age"> I am a man, older than 60</label><br>
    </form>
    <p></p>

3. Single choice poll: How long have you been staying in Germany?

    <form>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> Less than half a year</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> Less than 1 year</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> Less than 1.5 years</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> Less than 2 years</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> Less than 2.5 years</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> Less than 3 years</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> More than 3 years</label><br>
    <label><input type="radio" name="duration"> I do not live in Germany</label><br>
    </form>
    <p></p>

**Telegram Chat-Bot**.
To automate data collection, we developed a custom Telegram bot that:

- Recorded the poll state after each anonymous response
- Logged timestamps to later link responses across multiple polls

See the üõ† [Code](code.qmd) section for more details.

### üîÑ 2. Organizational Phase

We reviewed the list of Telegram groups from the [UAhelp Wiki](https://uahelp.wiki/german-city-chats), filtering out those with a purely commercial focus or that were no longer active. We then contacted their administrators to obtain permission to post our survey polls. This resulted in 100+ groups from over 80 locations, including several all-German channels that are thematic rather than location-based.

Due to limited capacity to manage multiple polls simultaneously, we conducted them in "waves", targeting around a dozen channels at a time during the period from *November 2024* to *January 2025*. Group administrators were encouraged to choose posting times that would maximize participation, though our organizational capacity remained the main limiting factor.

Some chats received only two of the three polls‚Äîthe one about problems and one additional, either demographic or about duration of stay. In general, we discouraged reposting polls across multiple channels, as this makes later disaggregation impossible. Our bot collects events separately for each poll.

### üí° 3. Our Innovation: Merging Polls for Deeper Insight

At the time of data collection, Telegram limited poll complexity: a maximum of 10 options per poll and no support for linked or connected polls. In addition, to preserve respondent privacy, we used anonymous polls, which excluded the possibility of linking responses from the same user across different polls via their internal Telegram ID.

We also observed that auxiliary polls about demographics or duration of stay received 30‚Äì60% more responses than the main poll about problems. Possible reasons include group members' curiosity about these characteristics, and the fact that single-choice polls record a response immediately after selection. In contrast, multiple-choice polls‚Äîsuch as our problems poll‚Äîrequire clicking the "Vote" button after making selections, which some respondents may have forgotten to do.

All of the above makes complex analysis‚Äîsuch as identifying the distribution of problems by specific age groups and/or gender‚Äîimpossible.

Our solution to this problem is *intelligent response-time matching*. The idea is that when multiple polls appear together in a Telegram group, respondents tend to answer them within a short time interval. For instance, if responses to two polls occur less than 15 seconds apart‚Äîwhile being separated from other answers in each poll by more than a minute‚Äîwe can reasonably assume that this pair of responses belongs to the same participant.

The custom chatbot records individual answer events along with precise timestamps, making this matching strategy feasible, as illustrated in the following figure.

![Merging responses from two polls (purple and orange) posted in the same chat, based on the timing of answer collection. The top two rows show response events before merging; the bottom two rows show the remaining events after merging.](figures/methodology/ts_alignment.jpg){width=600px}

Using this algorithm, we successfully merged around 50% of the responses from the main poll about problems with corresponding demographic or stay duration answers. This enabled a deeper analysis of the data‚Äîfor example, examining how reported problems vary depending on the duration of stay.

### üìä 4. Data Processing & Visualization

The raw poll results are stored in .json files. This approach does not enforce a strict schema, allowing us to randomize the sequence of options in the problems poll and customize the language of questions according to group administrators‚Äô preferences.

Subsequent processing was performed in Python and included:

- Loading all .json files
- Unifying answer options by translating them into a common language, correcting typos if present, and ordering them consistently
- Merging poll data from all Telegram groups and enriching it with group metadata and geographical information
- Applying the intelligent response-time matching described above when necessary
- Visualizing the results in static plots and on an interactive map

See the üõ† [Code](code.qmd) section for more details, the üìä [Results](results.qmd) section for static plots, and the üåç [Map](map.qmd) to explore the survey geography.

### üìú 5. Ethical Considerations & Anonymity

Given the sensitivity of the data, we followed these key guidelines:

- No personally identifiable information (PII) was collected through the polls.
- Response linking based on timestamps was conducted without individual identities.
- All data was stored locally and used solely for research purposes.
- The full survey methodology and the main analysis code are publicly available.
