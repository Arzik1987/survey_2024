    "text": "📌 1. Preparation phase\nBefore launching the survey, we conducted an extensive research and design phase.\n\nResearch on existing surveys\nWe reviewed past surveys and studies on Ukrainian refugees, particularly those related to Germany, to identify their intersection with our intended questionnaire. Our goal was to align demographic questions, such as age categories, with those used in other surveys to facilitate easier comparisons.\n\n\nSelecting the opinion poll format\nOur primary focus as a group of volunteers was to explore the potential impact of our efforts. Given the small size of our core team, choosing Telegram channels dedicated to assisting Ukrainian refugees was a natural decision.\nTo maximize participation, we kept the poll simple and anonymous. Simplicity ensured that participants could respond directly within the Telegram channels they were already part of, rather than through a separate bot-led channel or external forms (e.g., Google Forms). Anonymity allowed those who preferred to keep their privacy to participate freely.\nTo achieve this, we used anonymous multi- and single-choice Telegram polls.\n\n\nDevelopment of a Telegram Chat-Bot\nTo automate data collection, we developed a custom Telegram bot that allowed to create : - Recorded every anonymous poll response. - Logged timestamps to later connect responses across multiple polls. - Stored data securely for post-processing.\n\n\nTesting the bot in pilot groups\nBefore launching at scale, we: - Tested the bot in several Telegram groups to ensure proper data capture. - Refined timestamp synchronization to allow for multi-poll analysis. - Validated that anonymity was preserved while collecting meaningful insights."

Organizational Phase\nTo reach as many Ukrainian refugees as possible, we worked with volunteer Telegram channels.\n\nCollaboration with Chat Administrators\n\nWe identified 100+ active Telegram groups where refugees communicated.\nContacted group admins to obtain permission for posting survey polls.\nEnsured that the survey was pinned or highlighted for better visibility.\n\n\n\nSurvey Deployment Strategy\n\nInstead of a single poll, we used a sequence of polls to cover different aspects (e.g., demographics, employment, housing).\nPolls were posted at optimal times to maximize engagement.\nThe chat-bot collected timestamps for every vote, allowing us to later link responses across multiple polls."

Innovative Solutions\nOne of the key innovations in our survey was the ability to link responses across multiple anonymous polls in a single channel.\n\nTimestamp-Based Poll Linking\n\nTelegram anonymous polls do not track user identities.\nBy logging timestamps for each vote, we could reconstruct response patterns across different questions.\nThis method preserved anonymity while allowing us to analyze correlations between responses.\n\n\n\nData Validation & Quality Control\nTo ensure data quality, we: - Filtered out duplicate votes (if a user tried to vote multiple times in the same poll). - Identified suspicious response patterns (e.g., sudden surges of votes in specific cities). - Compared data with external refugee statistics for consistency."
