    "text": "📌 1. Preparation phase\nBefore launching the survey, we conducted an extensive research and design phase.\n\nResearch on existing surveys\nWe reviewed past surveys and studies on Ukrainian refugees, particularly those related to Germany, to identify their intersection with our intended questionnaire. Our goal was to align demographic questions, such as age categories, with those used in other surveys to facilitate easier comparisons.\n\n\nSelecting the opinion poll format\nOur primary focus as a group of volunteers was to explore the potential impact of our efforts. Given the small size of our core team, choosing Telegram channels dedicated to assisting Ukrainian refugees was a natural decision.\nTo maximize participation, we kept the poll simple and anonymous. Simplicity ensured that participants could respond directly within the Telegram channels they were already part of, rather than through a separate bot-led channel or external forms (e.g., Google Forms). Anonymity allowed those who preferred to keep their privacy to participate freely.\nTo achieve this, we used anonymous multi- and single-choice Telegram polls.\n\n\nDevelopment of a Telegram Chat-Bot\nTo automate data collection, we developed a custom Telegram bot that allowed to create : - Recorded every anonymous poll response. - Logged timestamps to later connect responses across multiple polls. - Stored data securely for post-processing.\n\n\nTesting the bot in pilot groups\nBefore launching at scale, we: - Tested the bot in several Telegram groups to ensure proper data capture. - Refined timestamp synchronization to allow for multi-poll analysis. - Validated that anonymity was preserved while collecting meaningful insights."

Innovative Solutions\nOne of the key innovations in our survey was the ability to link responses across multiple anonymous polls in a single channel.\n\nTimestamp-Based Poll Linking\n\nTelegram anonymous polls do not track user identities.\nBy logging timestamps for each vote, we could reconstruct response patterns across different questions.\nThis method preserved anonymity while allowing us to analyze correlations between responses.\n\n\n\nData Validation & Quality Control\nTo ensure data quality, we: - Filtered out duplicate votes (if a user tried to vote multiple times in the same poll). - Identified suspicious response patterns (e.g., sudden surges of votes in specific cities). - Compared data with external refugee statistics for consistency."

The goal was to understand the needs of refugees, track how these needs evolve over time, and connect them to demographic characteristics. This understanding can help tailor volunteer activities to actual needs.\nThis report explains our methodology, including the main innovation: the use of a custom Telegram bot to automate the consolidation of poll results and the matching of response times, enabling us to combine answers from different polls (e.g., the “problems” and “demographics” polls) while preserving respondent anonymity. We also share key parts of the code, allowing others to run similar surveys. We chose not to make the raw data public, as it could be misused in manipulative analyses.\n\n📖 Methodology of the survey\n📊 Results\n🌍 Survey geography\n🛠 Code\n\nThe core team consists of four members (listed alphabetically):\n\nAnna\nAnna\nFelix\nVadim\n\nHowever, this project would not have been possible without the active cooperation of the volunteer chat administrators who supported the survey."
