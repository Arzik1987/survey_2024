    "text": "This page explains the methodology behind our opinion poll, outlining the key phases of the project‚Äîfrom preparation to data processing and visualization.\nUnlike conventional polls, our methodology may have coverage bias and nonresponse bias, which are difficult to quantify precisely. Although our results, where comparable, match those from official agencies quite well, extrapolating them to the overall population is at your own risk of erroneous conclusions.\n\nüìå 1. Preparation\nAt the preparation step we have analyzed the existing surveys of similar kind, decided on survey format, developed the bot which automatically collects the current results each time a new vote appears, and tested our ideas with a small scope sureveys.\nResearch on existing surveys. We reviewed past surveys on Ukrainian refugees, particularly those related to Germany, to identify their intersection with our intended questionnaire. Our goal was to align demographic questions, such as age categories, with those used in other surveys to facilitate easier comparisons.\nSelecting the opinion poll format. Our primary focus was to explore the potential impact of our efforts. Given the small size of our core team, choosing Telegram channels dedicated to assisting Ukrainian refugees was a natural decision.\nTo maximize participation, we kept the poll simple and anonymous. Simplicity ensured that participants could respond directly within the Telegram channels they were already part of, rather than through a separate bot-led channel or external forms (e.g., Google Forms). Anonymity allowed those who preferred to keep their privacy to participate freely.\nTo achieve this, we used anonymous multi- and single-choice Telegram polls. Telegram allows maximum 10 choice options per poll. We ended up with the following three polls to maximally use this limit and to not owerwhelm responers with the number of polls.\n\nMultiple choice poll: What problems related to moving and adapting to life in Germany are currently most important to you?\n\n Learning German  Employment  Bureaucratic procedures  Professional education, retraining  Housing, household setup  Medicine  Psychological problems  Loneliness  Adaptation and integration of children  Other options (including no critical problems related to moving to Germany)\n\n\n\nSingle choice poll.\n\n I am a woman, aged 18 to 29  I am a woman, aged 30 to 39  I am a woman, aged 40 to 49  I am a woman, aged 50 to 59  I am a woman, older than 60  I am a man, aged 18 to 29  I am a man, aged 30 to 39  I am a man, aged 40 to 49  I am a man, aged 50 to 59  I am a man, older than 60\n\n\n\nSingle choice poll: How long have you been staying in Germany?\n\n Less than half a year  Less than 1 year  Less than 1.5 years  Less than 2 years  Less than 2.5 years  Less than 3 years  More than 3 years  I do not live in Germany\n\n\n\n\nTelegram Chat-Bot. To automate data collection, we developed a custom Telegram bot that:\n\nRecorded the poll state after each anonymous response\nLogged timestamps to later link responses across multiple polls\n\nSee the üõ† Code section for more details.\n\n\n\nüîÑ 2.

    "text": "Welcome to the official survey report on Ukrainian refugees in Germany. This study was conducted via Telegram across over 100 volunteer-led channels throughout Germany. The goal was to understand the needs of refugees, track how these needs evolve over time, and connect them to demographic characteristics. This understanding can help tailor volunteer activities to actual needs.\nThis report explains our methodology, including the main innovation: the use of a custom Telegram bot to automate the consolidation of poll results and the matching of response times, enabling us to combine answers from different polls (e.g., the ‚Äúproblems‚Äù and ‚Äúdemographics‚Äù polls) while preserving respondent anonymity. We also share key parts of the code, allowing others to run similar surveys. We chose not to make the raw data public, as it could be misused in manipulative analyses.\n\nüìù Methodology of the survey\nüìà Results\nüåç Survey geography\nüõ† Code\n\nThe core team consists of four members (listed alphabetically):\n\nAnna\nAnna\nFelix\nVadim\n\nHowever, this project would not have been possible without the active cooperation of the volunteer chat administrators who supported the survey."
