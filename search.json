    "text": "This page explains the methodology behind our opinion poll, outlining the key phases of the project‚Äîfrom preparation to data processing and visualization.\nUnlike conventional polls, our methodology may have coverage bias and nonresponse bias, which are difficult to quantify precisely. Although our results, where comparable, match those from official agencies quite well, extrapolating them to the overall population is at your own risk of erroneous conclusions.\n\n\nüìå 1. Preparation\nAt the preparation step we have analyzed the existing surveys of similar kind, decided on survey format, developed the bot which automatically collects the current results each time a new vote appears, and tested our ideas with a small scope sureveys.\nResearch on existing surveys. We reviewed past surveys on Ukrainian refugees, particularly those related to Germany, to identify their intersection with our intended questionnaire. Our goal was to align demographic questions, such as age categories, with those used in other surveys to facilitate easier comparisons.\nSelecting the opinion poll format. Our primary focus was to explore the potential impact of our efforts. Given the small size of our core team, choosing Telegram channels dedicated to assisting Ukrainian refugees was a natural decision.\nTo maximize participation, we kept the poll simple and anonymous. Simplicity ensured that participants could respond directly within the Telegram channels they were already part of, rather than through a separate bot-led channel or external forms (e.g., Google Forms). Anonymity allowed those who preferred to keep their privacy to participate freely.\nTo achieve this, we used anonymous multi- and single-choice Telegram polls. Telegram allows maximum 10 choice options per poll. We ended up with the following three polls to maximally use this limit and to not owerwhelm responers with the number of polls.\n\nMultiple choice poll: What problems related to moving and adapting to life in Germany are currently most important to you?\n\n Learning German  Employment  Bureaucratic procedures  Professional education, retraining  Housing, household setup  Medicine  Psychological problems  Loneliness  Adaptation and integration of children  Other options (including no critical problems related to moving to Germany)\n\n\n\nSingle choice poll.\n\n I am a woman, aged 18 to 29  I am a woman, aged 30 to 39  I am a woman, aged 40 to 49  I am a woman, aged 50 to 59  I am a woman, older than 60  I am a man, aged 18 to 29  I am a man, aged 30 to 39  I am a man, aged 40 to 49  I am a man, aged 50 to 59  I am a man, older than 60\n\n\n\nSingle choice poll: How long have you been staying in Germany?\n\n Less than half a year  Less than 1 year  Less than 1.5 years  Less than 2 years  Less than 2.5 years  Less than 3 years  More than 3 years  I do not live in Germany\n\n\n\n\nTelegram Chat-Bot. To automate data collection, we developed a custom Telegram bot that:\n\nRecorded the poll state after each anonymous response\nLogged timestamps to later link responses across multiple polls\n\nSee the üõ† Code section for more details.\n\n\n\nüîÑ 2. Organizational Phase\nWe reviewed the list of Telegram groups from the UAhelp Wiki, filtering out those with a purely commercial focus or that were no longer active. We then contacted their administrators to obtain permission to post our survey polls. This resulted in 100+ groups from over 80 locations, including several all-German channels that are thematic rather than location-based.\nDue to limited capacity to manage multiple polls simultaneously, we conducted them in ‚Äúwaves‚Äù, targeting around a dozen channels at a time during the period from November 2024 to January 2025. Group administrators were encouraged to choose posting times that would maximize participation, though our organizational capacity remained the main limiting factor.\nSome chats received only two of the three polls‚Äîthe one about problems and one additional, either demographic or about duration of stay. In general, we discouraged reposting polls across multiple channels, as this makes later disaggregation impossible. Our bot collects events separately for each poll.\n\n\n\nüí° 3. Our Innovation: Merging Polls for Deeper Insight\nAt the time of data collection, Telegram limited poll complexity: a maximum of 10 options per poll and no support for linked or connected polls. In addition, to preserve respondent privacy, we used anonymous polls, which excluded the possibility of linking responses from the same user across different polls via their internal Telegram ID.\nWe also observed that auxiliary polls about demographics or duration of stay received 30‚Äì60% more responses than the main poll about problems. Possible reasons include group members‚Äô curiosity about these characteristics, and the fact that single-choice polls record a response immediately after selection. In contrast, multiple-choice polls‚Äîsuch as our problems poll‚Äîrequire clicking the ‚ÄúVote‚Äù button after making selections, which some respondents may have forgotten to do.\nAll of the above makes complex analysis‚Äîsuch as identifying the distribution of problems by specific age groups and/or gender‚Äîimpossible.\nOur solution to this problem is intelligent response-time matching. The idea is that when multiple polls appear together in a Telegram group, respondents tend to answer them within a short time interval. For instance, if responses to two polls occur less than 15 seconds apart‚Äîwhile being separated from other answers in each poll by more than a minute‚Äîwe can reasonably assume that this pair of responses belongs to the same participant.\nThe custom chatbot records individual answer events along with precise timestamps, making this matching strategy feasible, as illustrated in the following figure.\n\n\n\nMerging responses from two polls (purple and orange) posted in the same chat, based on the timing of answer collection. The top two rows show response events before merging; the bottom two rows show the remaining events after merging.\n\n\nUsing this algorithm, we successfully merged around 50% of the responses from the main poll about problems with corresponding demographic or stay duration answers. This enabled a deeper analysis of the data‚Äîfor example, examining how reported problems vary depending on the duration of stay.\n\n\n\nüìä 4. Data Processing & Visualization\nThe raw poll results are stored in .json files. This approach does not enforce a strict schema, allowing us to randomize the sequence of options in the problems poll and customize the language of questions according to group administrators‚Äô preferences.\nSubsequent processing was performed in Python and included:\n\nLoading all .json files\nUnifying answer options by translating them into a common language, correcting typos if present, and ordering them consistently\nMerging poll data from all Telegram groups and enriching it with group metadata and geographical information\nApplying the intelligent response-time matching described above when necessary\nVisualizing the results in static plots and on an interactive map\n\nSee the üõ† Code section for more details, the üìä Results section for static plots, and the üåç Map to explore the survey geography.\n\n\n\nüìú 5. Ethical Considerations & Anonymity\nGiven the sensitivity of the data, we followed these key guidelines:\n\nNo personally identifiable information (PII) was collected through the polls.\nResponse linking based on timestamps was conducted without individual identities.\nAll data was stored locally and used solely for research purposes.\nThe full survey methodology and the main analysis code are publicly available."
